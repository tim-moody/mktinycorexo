How to create a Tiny Core Linux bootable USB drive
from upstream distribution components:

1.  select a system for building with; such as an OLPC XO running OLPC
    OS 13.2.0, ensure you have an internet connection, and install
    git, patch and rsync:

    yum install -y git patch rsync

2.  clone the repository,

    git clone http://dev.laptop.org/~quozl/mktinycorexo/.git
    cd mktinycorexo

3.  select a USB drive, plug it your build system and identify the
    drive from /proc/partitions ... it will usually be /dev/sda1.

4.  unmount the USB drive,

    umount /dev/sda1

5.  run the script as root:

    sudo mktinycorexo /dev/sda1

6.  remove the USB drive and boot from it.


If disk space is required on the builder, you can remove the cache/
directory, as it contains downloads.

See mktinicorexo --help for further information.
