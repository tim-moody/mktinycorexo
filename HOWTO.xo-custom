How to create a Tiny Core Linux bootable USB drive
for customising an installation of OLPC OS on an XO.


Build Tiny Core Linux as described in HOWTO, but add the option
--xo-custom, which will enable customisation.

There are two methods of adding activities and scripts -- adding them
during creation of the bootable USB drive, or adding them afterwards:

*   during creation of the bootable USB drive,

    With a text editor generate the customisation_bundles file and add
    a list of the activities and bundles to be added.  To have your
    customisations included at building time, place Sugar activities
    in the directory cache/bundles/ or provide a URL to download the
    files from using the --bundles_url option of the mktinycorexo
    script.  Place additional commands in the directory
    cache/scripts/.

*   after creation of the bootable USB drive,

    You can add or change your customisations directly to the USB
    drive in /bundles and /scripts.


When booted from the USB drive, the target XO will do the four
customisation steps below in the context of a chroot, with the USB
drive will be mounted at /media.

1.  each Sugar activity bundle, each content bundle, and each boot
animation customisation bundle, found in the directory /bundles/, will
be automatically installed, see
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Customization_stick for how to assemble the
/bundles/ directory.

2.  a script named asroot in the directory /scripts/ will be run as
root,

3.  a script named asolpc in the directory /scripts/ will be run as
user olpc,

4.  if files yum.conf and yum.cmd in the directory /scripts/ are
present, then the command in yum.cmd will be run as user root, using
the yum.conf configuration file,

After completion, you will be asked to "Press enter to shutdown and
then remove USB drive".  Once the power is off, you can remove the USB
drive.

Example asroot:
-----------------
#!/bin/bash

# set the time zone to Canada/Central
cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Canada/Central /etc/localtime

# copy some file to the XO
# cp /media/<file> /path/on/xo
-----------------

Example asolpc:
-----------------
#!/bin/bash

# copy a file from USB drive into Documents
cp /media/howto.txt ~/Documents/

# make a change to a file
# sed -i -e '/replacethis/withthis/' /some/file

# set language default
cat << EOF > ~/.i18n
LANG=en_AU.UTF-8
LC_ALL=en_AU.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_GB.utf8:en_US.utf8
EOF
-----------------

Example yum setup:

Provide /scripts/yum.conf, /scripts/yum.cmd, and a configured yum repo
and yum will be executed with -y -c pointing to /scripts/yum.conf and
/scripts/yum.cmd as the arguments. The yum.conf file would use
file:///media/<path/to/repo>

The example below shows how to install the xs-config-xo package.

yum.cmd:
-----------------
install xs-config-xo
-----------------

yum.conf:
-----------------
[main]
cachedir=/var/cache/yum
keepcache=1
debuglevel=2
exactarch=1
obsoletes=1
gpgcheck=0
plugins=0
installonly_limit=3

# disables /etc/yum.repos.d
reposdir=/tmp

# keep the log file
logfile=/home/olpc/.sugar/default/yum.log

# repository on the USB drive
[media.repo]
name=flash
baseurl=file:///media/xs-repo/armhfp/18/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=
